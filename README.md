# FastAPI Project

## Credits

This project is based on the Udemy course [`FastAPI - The Complete Course 2026 (Beginner + Advanced)`](https://www.udemy.com/course/fastapi-the-complete-course/) by Eric Roby and Chad Darby. Full credit goes to them for the course content and guidance.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a hands-on learning project for FastAPI, including practical integration with GitHub workflows.

## Content

Instead of following the course structure one-to-one, the implementations in `Project 3` were adapted based on my own experience.  
In particular, the project structure and testing strategy differ from the course in order to better reflect best practices.

- Authentication with JWT
- Routing
- Hashing Passwords with bcrypt

### Project 3.5

- Database and Data Migration with Alembic

### Project 4

- API testing with pytest
- Implemented in Project 3
